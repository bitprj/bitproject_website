## About Me

My name is Jakub Manda, I am a second year Computer and Electronic Systems student at University of Strathclyde. 

## The Premise

The idea behind this project is **based on my role on University of Strathclydeâ€™s Eco-Vehicle team** where I am one of the people in charge of recording the **telemetry data of our electric vehicle.** 

> The thing that I noticed and kept thinking about from the beginning was that when we are out on a track driving, or in a lab running tests on the vehicle, we arenâ€™t able to see the data of how the vehicle reacts right away, and instead we have to download all of the data and analyse it afterwards.

I have decided to solve this problem by designing solution that will allow us to ingest vehicleâ€™s data in real time, analyse in the cloud and visualise the data on a website for the end user to see how the vehicle is preforming. This includes data such as battery level, speed, acceleration, and GPS data that will be presented on map overlay.

## Tools used

- Azure IoT Hub  
- Azure Stream Analytics  
- Azure Functions  
- Azure SignalR Service  
- Azure Blob Storage  
- Bing Maps Dev Center

## Step by step (with code snippets)
### Set Up
Create Azure account  
Download VS Code https://code.visualstudio.com/download  
Dwnload Node.js  

### Create an IoT Hub
1. Sign in to the Azure portal.

2. From the Azure homepage, select the + Create a resource button, and then enter IoT Hub in the Search the Marketplace field.

3. Select IoT Hub from the search results, and then select Create.

4. On the Basics tab, complete the fields as follows:

    - **Subscription:** Select the subscription to use for your hub.

    - **Resource Group:** Select a resource group or create a new one. To create a new one, select Create new and fill in the name you want to use. To use an existing resource group, select that resource group.

    - **Region:** Select the region in which you want your hub to be located. Select the location closest to you. Some features, such as IoT Hub device streams, are only available in specific regions. For these limited features, you must select one of the supported regions.

    - **IoT Hub Name:** Enter a name for your hub. This name must be globally unique, with a length between 3 and 50 alphanumeric characters. The name can also include the dash ('-') character.

5. Select **Next: Review + create** to review your choices. You see something similar to this screen, but with the values you selected when creating the hub.

### Register a new device in the IoT hub

In this section, you create a device identity in the identity registry in your IoT hub. A device cannot connect to a hub unless it has an entry in the identity registry.

1. In your IoT hub navigation menu, open IoT Devices, then select New to add a device in your IoT hub.

2. In Create a device, provide a name for your new device, such as myDeviceId, and select Save. This action creates a device identity for your IoT hub. Leave Auto-generate keys checked so that the primary and secondary keys will be generated automatically.

3. After the device is created, open the device from the list in the IoT devices pane. Copy the Primary Connection String. This connection string is used by device code to communicate with the hub.

By default, the keys and connection strings are masked as they are sensitive information. If you click the eye icon, they are revealed as shown in the image below. It is not necessary to reveal them to copy them with the copy button

### Get Bing Map Key

1. Create Bing Maps account https://www.bingmapsportal.com/

2. Create an API Key

### Negotiate Function

For the SignalR link to work we need a negotiate function.

1. Create a HTTP Trigger called **negotiate**

2. Replace the content of index.js with the following:

```
module.exports = async function (context, req, connectionInfo) {
    context.res.body = connectionInfo;
};
```

3. Replace the content of index.json with the following:

```
{
  "bindings": [
    {
      "authLevel": "function",
      "type": "httpTrigger",
      "direction": "in",
      "name": "req",
      "methods": [
        "get",
        "post"
      ]
    },
    {
      "type": "http",
      "direction": "out",
      "name": "res"
    },
    {
      "type": "signalR",
      "name": "signalRMessages",
      "hubName": "serverless",
      "connectionStringSetting": "AzureSignalRConnectionString",
      "direction": "out"
    }
  ]
}
```

4. **Deploy** your function on Azure and add the 'AzureSignalRConnectionString' as a secret.

### Writing Function

This function will recieve data from Stream Analytics Job and 

1. Create a HTTP Trigger Function

2. The code that recieves the data and passes them into SingnalR shoould look something like this:

```
var data = req.body[0];
context.log(req.body[0]);

context.bindings.signalRMessages = [{
    "target": "newMessage",
    "arguments": [data]
}]
context.done();
```

3. In the function.json folder the following binding has to be added:

```
{
  "type": "signalR",
  "name": "signalRMessages",
  "hubName": "serverless",
  "connectionStringSetting": "AzureSignalRConnectionString",
  "direction": "out"
}
```

4. **Deploy** your function.

### Front End
    
> Instead of depoloying the front end as a Static Web App as intended at the begining, the front end will beusing a HTTP Trigger

1. Create a HTTP Trigger

2. In the same folder create HTML file

3. Place the following code in the index.js folder that loads the html file:

```
var fs = require('fs').promises

module.exports = async function (context, req) {
    //const path = context.executionContext.functionDirectory + '/../index.html'
    try {
        var data = await fs.readFile('index/index.html');
        context.res = {
            headers: {
                'Content-Type': 'text/html'
            },
            body: data
        }
        context.done()
    } catch (error) {
        context.log.error(error);
        context.done(error);
    }
}
```

4. In the html file place in a script that will access the SignalR data:

```
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/microsoft-signalr/3.1.7/signalr.min.js"></script>
<script>
    let messages = document.querySelector('#messages');
    const apiBaseUrl = window.location.origin;
    const connection = new signalR.HubConnectionBuilder()
      .withUrl(apiBaseUrl + '/api')
      .configureLogging(signalR.LogLevel.Information)
      .build();
    connection.on('newMessage', (message) => {
      // code to diplay data goes here
    });

    connection.start()
      .catch(console.error);
  </script>
```

5. In the html file place in a script that will create a map:

```
<script type='text/javascript'>
    var map;
    var pushpin;
    function loadMapScenario() {
      map = new Microsoft.Maps.Map(document.getElementById('myMap'), {
        center: new Microsoft.Maps.Location(55.861340, -4.243425),
        zoom: 18,
        showMapTypeSelector: false
      });
      pushpin = new Microsoft.Maps.Pushpin(map.getCenter(), { color: 'rgb(0, 165, 255)' });
      map.entities.push(pushpin);
    }
    function update(long, lat) {
      map.setView({ center: new Microsoft.Maps.Location(long, lat) });
      pushpin.setLocation(new Microsoft.Maps.Location(long, lat));
    }
</script>
  <script type='text/javascript'
    src='https://www.bing.com/api/maps/mapcontrol?key=YourAPIKey&callback=loadMapScenario'
    async defer></script>
```

## Challenges + lessons learned

Large challange when building this project was trying to chose the correct tools for the job as I have never worked with Azure Services beffore and there are so many choose from. This is linked with the next challenge which was trying to come uo with an appropriate structure for the project.

Another challenge was tryinn to read data from the IoT Hub and figuring out how effective Stream Analytics is in that aspect.

## Thanks and Acknowledgements

I would firstly like to thanks the Bit Project for giving me the opportunity to take part in this session of Serverless camp and learn about Cloud based services in association with Microsoft.

I would also like to thank my mentor Ganesh Raskar for his great input in the planing and structuring this project.
