Amazon is a service known for convenience and efficiency. *However, it is often frustrating to buy a product on Amazon only to find out that another site was selling it for less, or that the item was sold at a discount shortly after.*

Recently, I gained skills related to serverless functions through BitProject, and found the **PERFECT** way to save myself lots money and frustration! Through serverless computing, automating the task of observing a product's price becomes a fun and affordable challenge. 

#### Thats how I started developing PriceScraper, a web app that takes in an Amazon link and some basic information and sends a message if an item fluctuates in price.

## About me
My name is Fifi Teklemedhin (she/her), and I am a rising senior at West High School in Salt Lake City. I enjoy Computer programming, robotics, cheerleading, and participating in HOSA! Advocacy for equitable access to CS and humanitarian technologies are two of my interests.

## Technologies & More

### The program interface is a basic form with fields for:
* A link to a product
* A phone number
* The number of days the user wants to receive notifications
* A baseline discount percentage for the item

## What did I use?
### **Azure Function HTTP Trigger:** 
The website triggers an Azure Function HTTP trigger, which inputs the user input and scraped data into a SQL database. *After learning so much about using APIs, HTTP Triggers were a great way to build one myself.*

### **Azure Timer Trigger:** 
Checks the price of the item every day, updates the database, and sends a text message to the user under three conditions. *Timer Triggers provide an easy solution if you need to run your code on a set interval, and helped me understand "triggers" in serverless better.*

### **Twilio API:** 
The user is sent a text message if an item's price increases from the time the user submits the form, the price decreases to the desired discount value, or the notification period is reached. *Through Twilio, I was able to learn how to integrate SMS into my projects to communicate with users.*

### **SQL Database:** 
The database communicates with the Timer Trigger to store data. The data stored in the database is then queried to evaluate when to send alerts to the user. *In almost any project, storing data is always key to making it functional; learning SQL helped immensely.*

## Thoughts & what's next...

Through the power of **Azure Functions**, PriceScraper is able to help you save plenty of money and frustration when it comes to shopping on Amazon. Take a look at my [Github Repository](https://github.com/FifiTeklemedhin/BitcampServerlessProjectFinal/tree/main/Bitcamp%20Serverless%20Final%20Project) for the source code!

### Special Thanks:

I would also like to thank BitProject and Microsoft, who inspired me to create this project! I am grateful to have learned about cloud computing and Azure in such a fun and engaging way.
